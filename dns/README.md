# dns

- `pihole` is a [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) (and more!)
- `unbound` is a [recursive DNS server](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/what-is-recursive-dns/)

Together, these services provide an _All-Around DNS Solution_
and their need and usefulness is best described in
[this page](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/) of Pi-hole's documentation.
